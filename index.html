                Hrishikesh Chary started learning Veena at the age of six from his father,
                Sri Srikanth Chary, who is a disciple of late music maestro, Sri Lalgudi G. Jayaraman. Hrishikesh
                has performed solo veena concerts in USA and India. He has performed on television and provided
                orchestral accompaniment for various programs, CD releases, and dance performances. In 2014,
                Hrishikesh was selected as a Fellow by Indian Raga, and awarded a music fellowship. In addition,
                Hrishikesh has received vocal training from Smt. Hema Sista, a disciple of the late
                Smt. M. L. Vasanthakumari. Hrishikesh has won several prizes in veena and vocal competitions
                including the prestigious Cleveland Aradhana Concert Competition, and was awarded a tambura and
                the opportunity to present a veena concert at the 2011 festival. He has also been invited to
                participate in instrumental ensembles, including performances with Sri V. V. Subrahmanyam,
                at the Cleveland Festival. Hrishikesh has collaborated with other musicians as part of
                instrumental ensembles. He performs veena duets with his sister Priyanka regularly in Chennai
                during the Margazhi Music Festival. Hrishikesh has a Bachelor’s degree in Chemical Engineering

                              taking away all obstacles for Katyayani Vratam (prayer) and as a result, he greatly
                              admires the music and sounds from various instruments around him.</p>

                              announces Swayamvaram for his daughter Sita. Anyone who can wield the heavy Bow
                              (which was presented to Janaka by lord Shiva) string it and break it, could get his
                              daughter as his wife. Many Kings and Rakshasas along with Ravana brahma tried but
                              failed to do so. Lord Rama attended the Swayamvaram on his way back to Ayodhya with
                              Lakshmana and Brahmarishi Viswamitra after guarding the sacred ritual of Brahmarishi
                              Viswamitra from Rakshasas. Lord Rama successfully wields the heavy bow easily,
                              strings it and breaks the bow and marries Sita with great pride.</p>

                              between him and the gopikas. One of the gopikas (Radha) who is deeply in love with him,
                              secretly complains to her confidante about Krishna's mischievous behavior with the
                              other
                              Gopikas. As Krishna neglects her and sports with many other gopikas in the Brundavana
                              (park),
                              she feels melancholy while also having a bit of hope of his return to her. She laments
                              that
                              she lost her dignity and that she was burning with envy. She describes how beautiful
                              his
                              melodies are when he plays his flute, how beautiful the surroundings are when he is
                              around,
                              but still feels a hint of jealousy when she feels as if Lord Krishna is ignoring her.</p>

                              of snakes fit gracefully on his neck, lovely jewelry decorates all of his body, and the
                              curved moon and ganga (sacred river) sits beautifully on top of his head, excelling his
                              appearance. The dancer portrays how even when wearing the skin of a tiger while holding

                              make melodious sounds of Samaveda. Her motherly figure blesses all of her devotees with

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">In this song, the dancer is describing the mischief of
                              young Krishna and how gopikas
                              are confused by his menace in the perspective of both a gopika and Krishna. This song
                              is about a woman suggesting other women on how to pacify the little boy who seems
                              adorable but is difficult to control because of his tantrums and mischief. The tone
                              is set to a complaining tone. The background is set to a child being taken care- of
                              by other women, while the child’s mother is away. A gopika who seems to have been
                              given the responsibility to take care of Krishna in his mother's absence is looking
                              for him. She asks others "where is the boy who played cutely? Get hold of him and give
                              him a stomach full of milk."</p>

            <p class="align-para">Today marks one of my biggest milestones and such a special and unforgettable day for
              me
              Honestly, it couldn’t have been possible without certain people who have played a large role in my
              dancing
              journey. First and foremost, I would like to thank my hardworking, and wonderful Guru, Smt. Sunita
              Pendekanti.
              By pushing me to be the best dancer I can be, never giving up on me, always encouraging me through the
              classes,
              giving me countless corrections, she has made me into the best version of myself and taught me
              discipline,
              responsibility, and helped me overcome some of my greatest fears (stage fear) by giving me the confidence
              in myself. I want to gratefully thank my parents who have worked tirelessly these past few years with the
              pandemic on the rise in order to make today a success, put me first in times of need, and constantly gave
              me
              the support I needed mentally and physically. Next, I would like to give a special thanks to all of my
              extended family, Orchestra, and behind the scene volunteers for helping out in different parts of my
              Special
              day and even every small little thing that only made today so much more special. Lastly, I want to thank
              my
              dance friends and school friends who have served as one of my biggest support systems and motivating
              factors
              throughout this process, and helped me through many of the obstacles I faced over the past few years.
              Once
              again, the countless people including everyone who came here today worked towards making this event a
              huge
              success and helped me do what I love, Dance! “Without you all it would not have made my day special” I
              Love You All</p>
